The unshift() or insert function has O(n^2) time complexity and therefore takes longer to execute as the array sizes increase. The append function is shorter time complexity at O(n), it increases linearly while insert increases exponentially. 

EC: The unshift method has to increment all the elements already in the array while the append or push method only has to insert at the end, the size of the array does not slow push().
